# Configuration

OMOP_Alchemy reads all database connection and schema settings from
[oa_configurator](https://github.com/AustralianCancerDataNetwork/oa-configurator) — no
`.env` files or `ENGINE` environment variables needed.

## Minimal config

Run the interactive configure command to set up the CDM database connection and write
`~/.config/omop/config.toml`:

```bash
omop-config configure omop_alchemy
```

This prompts for connection details (host, dialect, credentials) and schema name, then
saves them under the canonical database name `cdm_db` that all OMOP stack packages
recognise.

The resulting TOML looks like:

```toml
[connections.cdm]
dialect       = "postgresql+psycopg"
host          = "localhost"
port          = 5432
user          = "omop"
password      = "changeme"
database_name = "omop_cdm"

[databases.cdm_db]
kind        = "cdm"
connection  = "cdm"
schema_name = "omop"

[tools.omop_alchemy]
cdm_db = "cdm_db"
```

You can also write or edit this file manually.

## Vocabulary loading

If you plan to load OMOP vocabulary from Athena CSV files, add the path to `[tools.omop_alchemy]`:

```toml
[tools.omop_alchemy]
cdm_db              = "cdm_db"
athena_source_path  = "/path/to/athena/csvs"
```

Or set it interactively:

```bash
omop-config configure omop_alchemy
```

## Verify

```bash
omop-alchemy info
```

This prints the resolved config file path, connection details, and schema. A successful
run confirms that OMOP_Alchemy can reach your database.

## Multiple instances

To configure a second CDM database (e.g. for production), create it under its own name
and point the field's own flag at it:

```bash
omop-config databases add cdm_db_prod --kind cdm --connection cdm_prod
omop-config configure omop_alchemy --cdm-db cdm_db_prod
```

This creates `cdm_db_prod` without touching the existing `cdm_db`. There is no "default"
toggle to flip afterward; each deployment's `configure` call names the entry it wants
directly.
